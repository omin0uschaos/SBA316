# UPA Profile Generator

## Overview

The UPA Profile Generator is a dynamic web application designed to streamline the creation and management of profiles for members of the Universal Protection Alliance (UPA). Inspired by state-of-the-art UI/UX designs found on platforms like Dribbble and godly.website, this project commenced with a sketch, evolved through a detailed Figma design, and was brought to life with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

The application offers a seamless user experience for creating, viewing, and managing profiles, incorporating advanced features such as custom calendar input, skill selection, and real-time form validation. This project not only showcases proficiency in DOM manipulation and event-driven programming but also emphasizes the importance of user-centric design.

## Features

- **Dynamic Profile Creation**: Users can input personal information, select skills from a dropdown, and choose their birth date from a custom-built calendar.
- **Live Form Validation**: Ensures data integrity with immediate feedback on user input, utilizing HTML validation attributes and JavaScript.
- **Interactive UI**: Toggle between editing and viewing profiles with ease, thanks to an intuitive navigation system.
- **LocalStorage Integration**: Profiles are saved locally, allowing for persistent data management without the need for a backend database.

## Technical Stack
